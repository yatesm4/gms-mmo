So this is just a little side project I've started with Game Maker and some Javascript, coupled with a local server (for now). The main dependencies if you want to run this game are as follows:
          
                - Node.JS
                - MongoDB & RoboMongo 1.0-RC1
                - WebStorm or another advanced Javascript IDE (for Node.JS)
                - Game Maker (1.5+)
                - Other Javascript libraries that can all be found in the source
                
4/8/17 - At its current state, if you were to want to run it, you would just launch a database with MongoDB and RoboMongo, start up the server by configuring your IDE to your Node interpreter and have it execute server.js, and then run the game client through Game Maker. Its current features are registering an account and signing in, and once in the game itself - you can just test walking around. The game is literally at its bare bones right now, as most of its current development lifetime has been working on the server aspect itself, and setting up the packets to be sent. Packet sending has definitely been the most confusing process of all of this, especially since this project has been one of the biggest learning experiences I've had as well. Primarily because this is the first game I've ever worked on in general; so if you see any major mistakes in anything, please feel free to constructively criticize. All that said, with most of the server framework completed for this portion of development, I can now focus more on the actual game aspect of things (incorporating other players, map building, sprites/art&music, etc)

4/11/17 - Major update in the sense of progression, minor update when you consider the scale of the overall game down the line. Development of the server has been completed for now. Users from multiple clients can now log in (if they are all connected to the same server, which atm is just a local server and database), or register an account, and then walk around the game world. During this, they will be able to see any other active user/client in the game world (and interact with them, if you want to call it that). User sessions will be saved, and they will be able to pick back up where they left off the next they log in. There are a few minor bugs, however. Since I haven't implemented other client-side features, like properly exiting the game in this example, slight errors can occur. For instance, not properly exiting the game will cause the server log to print "Error: This socket has been ended by the other part" the next time the user logs in and send any packet to the server. Nothing major, however it is a bug that will need to be fixed down the line. Other obvious bugs are simply the login screen having input errors (that I can't figure out just yet), and the extremely blatant lack of animations for characters. These aren't really errors or bugs, and are moreso just parts of development I haven't gotten to yet. However, feel free to try the game out for yourself - if you have the proper dependencies installed! I can not stress enough that for now, if you don't have the necessary requirements - the game will not work at all. This is temporary, as is normal for most pre-alpha developments.
